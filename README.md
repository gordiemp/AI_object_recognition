## Project Description

The application uses a pre-trained model from PyTorch to classify objects in any given image. Once the model classifies the objects, the results can be used for various purposes depending upon the use case. The model, the application, and all supporting files are containerized using Docker and can be easily deployed and run on AWS.

## Prerequisites

- Python 
- Docker
- AWS account
